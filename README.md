# udemy-practice
This is where I refine my skills by constantly taking Udemy courses. I push the contents of the course here, including my practice files, to be able to clone them from wherever I am. I also practice git this way.

# My Learning Idealogy
I primarily learn by doing. Practice, fail, repeat. 

# My Learning Methodology
As I face new challanges or get new project ideas, I brush up the concepts first with Udemy content, YouTube videos, or online articles. So I work on concurrent projects. For example, if I get task with an NLP project at work, I will refresh/improve my skills by taking or retaking a Udemy course (after hours of course) at the same time I am building the NLP project at work. This helps me be more productive during my working hours and more creative when comming with new solutions.
